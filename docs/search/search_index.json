It's called \"Select Backfacing\" and can be found in addon preferences and 3D View header. It's enabled by default. Disabling this option will exclude vertices, edges, and faces with normals pointing away from you from selection. Added a shortcut to toggle state of \"Select Backfacing\" to addon preferences. 4.4.0 Added options for setting tools as active in the toolbar automatically when you start blender or load a save file. Added compatibility with blender 4.0 4.3.5 Added option to hide the gizmo during selection to the addon preferences. Disabled by default. Fixed a bug of continuous circle selection in \"SET\" mode. Improved performance of selection in mesh mode with enabled \"Select All Edges/Faces\" options for Blender 3.6.0 and later versions. Improved performance of Contain and Overlap lasso and circle selection and box Contain selection in object mode for Blender 3.6.0 and later versions. 4.3.4 \u0421ross-platform shader generation. Minor bugfixes. 4.3.3 Improved performance of selection in mesh mode with enabled \"Select All Edges/Faces\" options for Blender 3.5.0 and later versions. Improved performance of Contain and Overlap lasso and circle selection and box Contain selection in object mode for Blender 3.5.0 and later versions. Fixed restoring X-Ray alpha amount in wireframe mode. 4.3.2 Fixed a bug with tools disabling an already enabled x-ray in wireframe mode. Minor performance improvements. 4.3.1 Improved performance of selection in mesh mode with enabled \"Select All Edges/Faces\" options for Blender 3.4.0 and later versions. 4.3.0 Improved performance of selection in mesh mode with enabled \"Select All Edges/Faces\" options. 4.2.6 Changed labels and tooltips in addon preferences to make them more descriptive. Reordered some buttons in addon preferences. 4.2.5 Fixed a conflict with addons that use timer (like Hardops or Screencast Keys) that could cause x-ray shading to stop working. 4.2.4 Fixed circle select fallback tools requiring a click to start selection by disabling wait_for_input, copying default blender tool behavior. 4.2.3 Fix for wrong fallback tool keys registration when blender selection is set to right mouse button. Changed a couple of labels in addon preferences to make them more descriptive. 4.2.2 Fixed bug on releasing circle select in object mode and fallback tool keyitems. 4.2.1 Fixed directory structure and bug on releasing circle selection in mesh mode. 4.2.0 Update to Blender 3.3.1 4.1.0 Box and lasso tool settings for edit mode can be configured separately for left-to-right and right-to-left drag directions. 4.0.1 Fixed shaders in blender fullscreen, added shortcut for toggling addon preferences. 4.0.0 Added contain and overlap selection behavior modes for object tools to addon preferences, similar to autodesk Window/Crossing selection. Contain behavior select objects fully contained in the selection region. Overlap behavior selects objects touching and inside the selecting region. Added directional behavior for automatically switching between contain and overlap selection mode. Drag from left to right to select all objects that are entirely contained in the selection box or lasso, drag from right to left to select all objects that are overlapped by the selection box or lasso. Added shortcut configuration for tool selection mode (Set, Extend, Subtract etc.) for individual tools. Fixed selection mode buttons in header and properties active tool tab. Speed up circle selection in mesh mode. Improved drawing of lasso shader. 3.1.0 Added shortcut configuration for tool selection mode (Set, Extend, Subtract etc.) in the addon preferences Advanced Keymap tab. Added header buttons in Advanced Keymap to disable/enable addon preinstalled shortcuts. Disabled shortcuts won't be added and won't clutter a blender keyconfig. 3.0.1 Fixed disabling hiding modifiers. 3.0.0 Reworked the addon preference panel, since it used to be confusing. Selection through can be toggled by pressing or holding a user-set set button during selection. You can set a different color for tools with enabled selection through. Implemented selection of all faces and edges in select through mode for lasso select and circle select tools. Rewritten code in numpy to improve performance. 2.0.14 Fixed issues with addon registration.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"changelog/#450","text":"Added option for ignoring backfacing elements during selection through.

Selection through This toggle defines whether the x-ray tools will select through or not. The button below allows you to toggle the state of selection through. For example, you can turn off selection through and x-ray tools will work just like the default blender tools and set a key to turn it on when it's needed: Your browser does not support the video tag. Selection frame colors Setting different colors can be useful to see if selection through is enabled or not if you disabled x-ray shading: Your browser does not support the video tag. Show x-ray shading When this toggle is turned off, x-ray shading won't automatically turn on in selection through mode: Your browser does not support the video tag. Select all edges and faces By default, in selection through mode tools select edges that have both their vertices inside the selection region and faces with their center dot inside the selection region: Your browser does not support the video tag.

Disable this option if you want to select only elements with back side facing away from you (this is slower than the default selection on meshes with a lot of geometry): Your browser does not support the video tag.
